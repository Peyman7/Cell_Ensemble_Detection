# Cell_Ensemble_Detection

This repository contains code for analyzing spike time series data, including the following features:

  - Cell Assembly Detection (CAD): Extracts cell ensembles using CAD within parallel processing pipeline. 
  - Data Analysis and Visualization: Provides tools for clustering cell ensembles, visualizing results, and analyzing their correlation with brainwaves, including Sharp-Wave Ripples and Cortical Spindles.
  - Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA): Implements GPFA to reduce neural dimensionality and study dynamics during the course of training.
