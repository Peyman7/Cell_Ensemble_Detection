# Cell_Ensemble_Detection

This repository contains code for analyzing spike time series data, including the following features:

  - Cell Assembly Detection (CAD): Extracts cell ensembles using CAD (Russo, Eleonora, and Daniel Durstewitz. "Cell assemblies at multiple time scales with arbitrary lag constellations." Elife 6 (2017): e19428).
  - Developed High-Performance Computing(HPC) pipeline using Python and Slurm to parallelize neural data analysis, reducing runtime and enabling large-scale spike train pattern detection. 
  - Data Analysis and Visualization: Provides tools for clustering cell ensembles, visualizing results, and analyzing their correlation with brainwaves, including Sharp-Wave Ripples and Cortical Spindles.
